# Talk: Learning with Tools
## Overview

This talk is part of a series focused on **Learning**.

The two basic ideas behind the **Learning Series** are:

1. As knowledge workers, **Learning** is fundamental to both our
   day-to-day happiness and our long-term happiness with our career.

2. The better we get at **Learning** the happier we will become.

The core idea behind this talk, **Learning ..with tools** is:

1. We all use *tools* everyday to get our work done.

1. If we share our approach, our method, our strategies, all of which
   revolve around the concrete tools we use, we can only become
   happier.

Maybe you know something someone else doesn't? Maybe they know
something you don't? Let's share.

That said, the remainder of this talk includes specific examples of
"tools" that work for me. These are the things I'd start sharing if we
sat down together and talked.

You might find this interesting if work on the same sorts of things
that I do. Yet, knowing that I've got a mixed audience here and you
probably won't find this interesting, I've tried to start with widely
applicable ideas and then slowly narrow things down toward stuff
that's probably only interesting to programmers.

So.. here we go.

This is going to be intentionally wide-ranging and quick, but if you
remember only one thing, here's the punchline:

> Your happiness stems from what you create. Share your tools,
> thoughts, and approach to your art.

## Meta-tools

Let's talk about the tools that I'm using to give this talk about
learning with tools.

### reveal.js / rvl.io

Let's start with what you're looking at on the screen. This
presentation is delivered via a framework called
"[reveal.js][reveal-js-home]" It's an HTML page, so it can be served
up anywhere you can get a connection. It runs on an iPad or iPhone.

There's an online demo that contains a survey of the functionality it
offers. You can create these things by modifying HTML or using a
[WYSIWYG experience][rvl-io-home].

Why do I use this? I like reveal.js because I can create slides in my
favorite editor, I can post them online, and I've got decent browser
support (iPad).

### Slate

Until a few months ago, I had never used a window manager on MacOS,
but I had always been envious of people that had them. I started using
Slate, and you may notice me doing the following with a window:

1. Making it be 1/4 of the screen size and placing it in a corner.
1. Making it be 1/2 of the screen size, and placing it on one of the
   halves.
1. Making it be the entire size of the screen (full screen)
1. Making the currently activated screen go to my second monitor.

It also lets me jump between windows.

If you want to get started with slate, you can check out
[the homepage][slate-home]. If you want to get up and running quickly
with my setup, you can check out
[some notes][getting-started-with-slate] that I wrote up.

Why do I use this? I don't like taking my fingers off the keyboard. I
can reduce

### MacOS Zoom

Apple > System Preferences > Trackpad > Two Fingers > Screen Zoom

Zoom in any part of your screen without changing anything. Helps me
present. Helps me read: use slate to make something take up a quarter
of the screen, zoom in on it.

Why do I use this? If you're ever presenting to a room full of people,
you will sooner or later find yourself in a situation where you'd wish
that you could make the font larger. Most well-behaved applications
let you do this, but many of them "re-layout" the screen once you've
increased it and this can be less than optimal. Also, if you don't
have your eyeglasses. Also if you're doing design work and every last
pixel counts.

## Tools for Thought

In knowledge work, and life, your brain is too important to be
overlooked.

### General Theory of Brain Relativity

* Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow
* Pragmatic Thinking and Learning

### Pomodoro Technique

There's a bunch involved with the Pomodoro technique, but my real take
away is that how you choose to work can impact you after you leave
work. I liken it to physical exercise: if you had to run 26 miles in
the span of a week, every week, for a year, there are different ways
you could approach it that would lead to very different outcomes.

You could run a marathon every Monday, and then take the next 6 days
off, and repeat for 51 more weeks.

Or, you could run a mile, rest for an hour, and then repeat four times
a day.

Which would you rather do?

The same holds for you brain: if you cram it full of stuff and make it
handle distractions (like email, or meetings, or people dropping by)
and then cram it full again and keep it crammed for hours on end, my
observation is that you'll work less efficiently, accomplish less
overall, and be more tired at the end of the day. On days when there's
a bunch going on, it'll take longer to unwind and you might even have
harder trouble getting to, and staying, asleep.

You can read more about the pomodoro technique
[online](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) or in this
[book](http://pragprog.com/book/snfocus/pomodoro-technique-illustrated)

## Approaching Tools

It's often the case that the approach you take toward people, a
situation, or learning in general can be crucial. Here are three
important ideas I bring with me throughout the day.

### Local Maxima

Take a look at this image from the wikipedia article on
[Maxima and Minima][wikipedia-maxima-minima]:

![Wikipedia's Maxima Image][wikipedia-extrema-png]

If you're looking for the maximum value of a function in a region,
it's possible you may find a local maxima, but not the global maxima.
Functions exist to find maxima, but they can sometimes get "stuck in a
local maxima."

How do you know that you're not stuck in a local maxima?

When I started googling around for this, I saw that someone famous has
already spoken about it. [Seth Godin's write-up][seth-godin-local-max]
is exactly what I'm talking about.

### Birthday Paradox

What are the chances that two people in this room share the same
birthday?

From the wikipedia on the [Birthday Problem][wikipedia-birthday-problem]:

> In probability theory, the birthday problem or birthday paradox
> concerns the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people,
> some pair of them will have the same birthday. By the pigeonhole
> principle, the probability reaches 100% when the number of people
> reaches 367 (since there are 366 possible birthdays, including
> February 29). However, 99% probability is reached with just 57
> people, and 50% probability with 23 people.

We've got more than 57 people in this room, so almost certainly we've
got two people with the same birthday. That's likely a paradox because
when you think birthday and likelihood of matching somehow 1 in 365
appears in your head.

Okay, stepping back for a bit, what's the chance that someone is
having a really bad day?

Maybe they're in pain.
Maybe they're sick.
Maybe they are caring for a sick child.
Maybe they are caring for a sick parent.
Maybe it's a serious sickness.
Maybe they are young, and lonely.
Maybe they are old, and lonely.
The list goes on.

What are the chances for anyone one of those things to be happening to
someone? Much more likely than 1 in 365.

So, when I go out and about, I hope everyone's doing great, but I try
to treat everyone as if they might be having a really bad day.
