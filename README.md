# Talk: Learning with Tools
## Overview

This talk is part of a series focused on **Learning**.

The two basic ideas behind the **Learning Series** are:

1. As knowledge workers, **Learning** is fundamental to both our
   day-to-day happiness and our long-term happiness with our career.

2. The better we get at **Learning** the happier we will become.

The core idea behind this talk, **Learning ..with tools** is:

1. We all use *tools* everyday to get our work done.

1. If we share our approach, our method, our strategies, all of which
   revolve around the concrete tools we use, we can only become
   happier.

Maybe you know something someone else doesn't? Maybe they know
something you don't? Let's share.

That said, the remainder of this talk includes specific examples of
"tools" that work for me. These are the things I'd start sharing if we
sat down together.

You might find this interesting if work on the same sorts of things
that I do. Yet, knowing that I've got a mixed audience here, I've
tried to start with widely applicable ideas and then slowly narrow
things down toward stuff that's probably only interesting to
programmers.

So.. here we go.

This is going to be intentionally wide-ranging and quick, but if you
remember only one thing, here's the punchline:

> Your happiness stems from what you create. Share your tools,
> thoughts, and approach to your art.

## Meta-Tools

### reveal.js / rvl.io

Let's start with what you're looking at on the screen. This
presentation is delivered via a framework called
"[reveal.js][reveal-js-home]" It's an HTML page, so it can be served
up anywhere you can get a connection. It runs on an iPad or iPhone.

There's an online demo that contains a survey of the functionality it
offers. You can create these things by modifying HTML or using a
[WYSIWYG experience][rvl-io-home].

Why do I use this? I like reveal.js because I can create slides in my
favorite editor, I can post them online, and I've got decent browser
support (iPad).

### Slate

Until a few months ago, I had never used a window manager on MacOS,
but I had always been envious of people that had them. I started using
Slate, and you may notice me doing the following with a window:

1. Making it be 1/4 of the screen size and placing it in a corner.
1. Making it be 1/2 of the screen size, and placing it on one of the
   halves.
1. Making it be the entire size of the screen (full screen)
1. Making the currently activated screen go to my second monitor.

It also lets me jump between windows.

If you want to get started with slate, you can check out
[the homepage][slate-home]. If you want to get up and running quickly
with my setup, you can check out
[some notes][getting-started-with-slate] that I wrote up.

Why do I use this? I don't like taking my fingers off the keyboard. I
can reduce

### MacOS Zoom

Apple > System Preferences > Trackpad > Two Fingers > Screen Zoom

Zoom in any part of your screen without changing anything. Helps me
present. Helps me read: use slate to make something take up a quarter
of the screen, zoom in on it.

Why do I use this? If you're ever presenting to a room full of people,
you will sooner or later find yourself in a situation where you'd wish
that you could make the font larger. Most well-behaved applications
let you do this, but many of them "re-layout" the screen once you've
increased it and this can be less than optimal. Also, if you don't
have your eyeglasses. Also if you're doing design work and every last
pixel counts.

## Tools for Thought

We miss out on too much if we don't pay attention to how the brain
works. Here are some things to think about:

* *Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow* and implications
* Pomodoro Technique
* Pragmatic Thinking and Learning

## Approaching Tools

* It is the student's job to learn (Pragmatic Thinking and Learning)
* Local Maxima
* Birthday Paradox

From the wikipedia:

> In probability theory, the birthday problem or birthday paradox[1]
> concerns the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people,
> some pair of them will have the same birthday. By the pigeonhole
> principle, the probability reaches 100% when the number of people
> reaches 367 (since there are 366 possible birthdays, including
> February 29). However, 99% probability is reached with just 57
> people, and 50% probability with 23 people.
