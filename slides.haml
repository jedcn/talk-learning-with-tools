    You don't get taught; you have to learn. We tend to look at the
    teacher/learner relationship the wrong way around: it's not that
    the teacher teaches; it's that the student learns. The learning is
    always up to you.

    when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes
    rather than ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. so
    create.
